types of inheritance 
there are mainly 4 types of inheritance

1) single level inheritance:
                one class derived properties of another class its called single level inheritance
                    a
                    |
                    v
                    B
2)Multi level inheritance :

        A                       B
        |                        |
        --------------------------
                    |
                    C

    there are 2 parents and 1 child in Multiple  inheritance that's why dart doesn't support this

    why dart doesn't support Multiple inheritance :

    in Multiple there are two parents and 1 child so, in techincally there are posibilites
    of abmubiguties (Confusion)

4) hierarchil inheritance
                A
        b             C

5) hybrid inheritance (dart doesn't support this)
                a
