operators : to perform any operations we need to use some specific symbols at that time its 
called operator 

10 + 20 

here,  + is an operator 

10 and 20 are operand 

1) Arithmetic operator 
2) Assignment operator 
3) conditional operator 
4) logical operator 
5) relational operator 
6) unary operator 
7) bitwise operator 
8) special operator 




1) Arithmetic operator : to perform any arithmetic operations using these operator 

	+   -    *    /    %   

	a + b 


2) Assignment operator : 

	to assign something 

	= 

	a = 10 

 shorthand operator : 

	combination of arithmetic and assignment operator 

	+=   -=  *=  /= %= 

	a = a + b 

	a+=b 

3) conditional operator (ternary operator) : 

	?: 

syntax :   exp1 ?  exp2  : exp3

4) relational operator : there are 6 relational operator 

	>     <   >=  <=  ==  != 

5) logical operator : 

	&&   (And operator) 

	||  (or operator) 

	!  (not operator) 


6) increment - decrement 

	a++     (post increment) 
	a--     (post decrement) 

	++a  (pre increment) 
	--a (pre decrement) 

7) bitwise operator 

8) special operator : 

	sizeof

	comma
